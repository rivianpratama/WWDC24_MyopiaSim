# MyopiaSim
### Swift Student Challenge Winner 2024 😎👍
MyopiaSim is visual novel game that I created to illustrate how the world looks with myopia, or nearsightedness, at different levels of diopters and distance. 
Through MyopiaSim, kids can experience visual impairment and learn to take better care of their eyes before it's too late, with a gamified approach like a conversational game in a step journey to make it kid-friendly.
